    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had to delete an S3 bucket containing over 200,000 objects. S3 prevents deletion of non-empty buckets, and deleting this many objects is virtually impossible using any GUI. I looked into an API-based approach but support for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/12/07/amazon-s3-announces-multi-object-delete/">multi-object delete</a> still seems limited.</p>

<p>If you don't mind waiting 24 hours for your bucket to be cleared, there's a very simple solution using S3's lifecycle feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home">S3 Management Console</a></li>
<li>Select the bucket you want to clear</li>
<li>Select Properties from the toolbar</li>
<li>Click the Lifecycle tab in the Properties panel</li>
<li>Add a rule with no prefix and expiration of 1 day</li>
<li>Save the rule</li>
</ul>


<p>Check back 24 hours later you'll find all your objects have been deleted.</p>
